## Text-promptable segmentation

### [NeurIPS 2023] Text Promptable Surgical Instrument Segmentation with Vision-Language Models
- Our model leverages multiple text prompts for each surgical instrument through a new mixture of prompts mechanism, resulting in enhanced segmentation performance. Additionally, we introduce a hard instrument area reinforcement module to improve image feature comprehension and segmentation precision.

### [arXiv 2023] AdaptiveSAM: Towards Efficient Tuning of SAM for Surgical Scene Segmentation
- We propose AdaptiveSAM - an adaptive modification of SAM that can adjust to new datasets quickly and efficiently, while enabling text-prompted segmentation.

## Non-text promptable segmentation

### [TIP 2024] Boundary-Aware Prototype in Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation
- Inspired by this, we propose a novel consistency learning framework based on the non-parametric distance metric of boundary-aware prototypes to alleviate this problem.
- Boundary-Aware Prototype Segmentation
- LA Dataset, Pancreas-NIH Dataset

### [arXiv 2023] Medical SAM Adapter: Adapting Segment Anything Model for Medical Image Segmentation
- following the official ViT-H SAM GitHub repository
- For the REFUGE2, TNMIX, and ISIC datasets, we trained the model for 40 epochs. For the BTCV and BraTs datasets, we extended the training to 60 epochs.

### [AAAI 2024] SurgicalSAM: Efficient Class Promptable Surgical Instrument Segmentation
- To address these problems, we introduce SurgicalSAM, a novel end-to-end efficient-tuning approach for SAM to effectively integrate surgical-specific information with SAM's pre-trained knowledge for improved generalisation. Specifically, we propose a lightweight prototype-based class prompt encoder for tuning, which directly generates prompt embeddings from class prototypes and eliminates the use of explicit prompts for improved robustness and a simpler pipeline. In addition, to address the low inter-class variance among surgical instrument categories, we propose contrastive prototype learning, further enhancing the discrimination of the class prototypes for more accurate class prompting. 
- The results of extensive experiments on both EndoVis2018 and EndoVis2017 datasets demonstrate that SurgicalSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance while only requiring a small number of tunable parameters.
