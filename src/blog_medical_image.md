### [arXiv 2023] Medical SAM Adapter: Adapting Segment Anything Model for Medical Image Segmentation
- following the official ViT-H SAM GitHub repository
- For the REFUGE2, TNMIX, and ISIC datasets, we trained the model for 40 epochs. For the BTCV and BraTs datasets, we extended the training to 60 epochs.

### [AAAI 2024] SurgicalSAM: Efficient Class Promptable Surgical Instrument Segmentation
- To address these problems, we introduce SurgicalSAM, a novel end-to-end efficient-tuning approach for SAM to effectively integrate surgical-specific information with SAM's pre-trained knowledge for improved generalisation. Specifically, we propose a lightweight prototype-based class prompt encoder for tuning, which directly generates prompt embeddings from class prototypes and eliminates the use of explicit prompts for improved robustness and a simpler pipeline. In addition, to address the low inter-class variance among surgical instrument categories, we propose contrastive prototype learning, further enhancing the discrimination of the class prototypes for more accurate class prompting. 
- The results of extensive experiments on both EndoVis2018 and EndoVis2017 datasets demonstrate that SurgicalSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance while only requiring a small number of tunable parameters.

### [MIA 2025] Medical SAM Adapter: Adapting Segment Anything Model for Medical Image Segmentation [[PDF]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841525000945)
- The main challenges in medical image segmentation lie in 3D image processing and the ambiguous boundaries between overlapped organs. 
- We also propose Space-Depth Transpose (SD-Trans) to adapt 2D SAM to 3D medical images and Hyper-Prompting Adapter (HyP-Adpt) to achieve prompt-conditioned adaptation

- We train One-Prompt Model on 64 open-source medical datasets, accompanied by the collection of over 3,000 clinician-labeled prompts. Tested on 14 previously unseen datasets, the One-Prompt Model showcases superior zero-shot segmentation capabilities, outperforming a wide range of related methods.

### [AAAI 2024] Medsegdiff-v2: Diffusion based medical image segmentation with transformer
- We propose a novel Spectrum-Space Transformer (SS-Former). Our key idea is to learn the interaction of condition semantic feature and diffusion noise feature in the frequency domain. 

### [TMI 2022] Exploring Intra- and Inter-Video Relation for Surgical Semantic Scene Segmentation
- We use a public challenge dataset from 2018 MICCAI Robotic Scene Segmentation Challenge, referred to as EndoVis18 [4]. The dataset parses the entire surgical scene into 12 classes, including different anatomy and robotic instruments.

### [Nature Communications 2024] Segment Anything in Medical Images
